# Muckyroo
Muckyroo is the Systemd fork of CosmicMod Gnu/Linux, which is a Gentoo based distro similar to Chrome OS except utilizes Plasma for the desktop, Firefox for the browser and is highly optimized for newer CPUs and GPUs.  Designed to be used as a desktop OS, a true live usb OS, a rescue/recovery environment or as an ideal build environment for your own Gentoo based build. 

This code repo only has information for building the disk image which is not necessary to utilize CosmicMod as it is already built and available in the releases section of the Wiki to download and install.  This cuts the installation time down from up to a week for building and compiling the image to just a few minutes by simply copying over a disk image and configuring a few things.  

See the Wiki section for most of the useful and relevant information for utilizing CosmicMod GNU/Linux.  http://cosmicmod.net
